Sign Language Recognition Project

A Python-based American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system with a fully functional front-end for static and dynamic modules, designed to make learning and practicing ASL interactive and intuitive. This project is perfect for showcasing hands-on AI/ML skills and real-time computer vision applications — ideal for internships.

Important parts of the project :

Static Module:

Upload a hand sign image and get the predicted letter.
Input a letter and get the corresponding hand sign image.
Front end implemented for easy interaction.

Dynamic Module:

Real-time hand sign recognition using webcam.
Displays predicted letter with confidence levels.
Works best with a white or monochromatic background.
Fully integrated front end for smooth user experience.

Practice Module (partial):

Interactive practice mode where the system gives a target letter to sign.
Tells you if your sign is correct, otherwise shows the correct hand sign image.
Designed for future extension with full front-end support.
