SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION PROJECT

A Python-based American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system with a fully functional front-end for static and dynamic modules, designed to make learning and practicing ASL interactive and intuitive. This project showcases hands-on AI/ML skills and real-time computer vision applications.

IMPORTANT PARTS :

Static part :

-> Upload a hand sign image and get the predicted letter.

-> Input a letter and get the corresponding hand sign image.

-> Front end implemented for easy interaction.

Dynamic Module :

-> Real-time hand sign recognition using webcam.

-> Displays predicted letter with confidence levels.

-> Works best with a white or monochromatic background.

-> Fully integrated front end for smooth user experience.

Practice Module (partial):

-> Interactive practice mode where the system gives a target letter to sign.

-> Tells you if your sign is correct, otherwise shows the correct hand sign image.

-> Designed for future extension with full front-end support.
